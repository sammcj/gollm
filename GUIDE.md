# Production Guide for the `gollm` Package

## Introduction

This guide provides best practices and recommendations for using the `gollm` package in a production environment. The `gollm` package offers a unified interface for interacting with various Language Model (LLM) providers, making it easier to integrate LLMs into your Go applications.

## Getting Started

1. Install the package:
   ```
   go get github.com/sammcj/gollm
   ```

2. Import the package in your Go code:
   ```go
   import "github.com/sammcj/gollm"
   ```

## Configuration Management

### Do's:
- Create separate configuration files for different environments (development, staging, production).
- Use environment variables to manage sensitive information like API keys.
- Implement a configuration validation step in your deployment pipeline.

### Don'ts:
- Don't hardcode configuration values in your application code.
- Avoid committing configuration files with sensitive information to version control.

Example configuration file (`~/.gollm/configs/production.yaml`):

```yaml
provider: anthropic
model: claude-3-opus-20240229
temperature: 0.7
max_tokens: 100
log_level: info
```

## LLM Client Initialization

### Do's:
- Initialize the LLM client once and reuse it across your application.
- Use a context with timeout for LLM operations to prevent hanging requests.

### Don'ts:
- Don't create a new LLM client for each request, as this can be inefficient.

Example:

```go
llm, err := gollm.NewLLM("/path/to/production.yaml")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to initialize LLM: %v", err)
}

// Use llm throughout your application
```

## Prompt Engineering

### Do's:
- Use the `Prompt` struct to create well-structured prompts.
- Leverage directives to guide the LLM's behavior.
- Set a maximum length for responses to control costs and response times.

### Don'ts:
- Avoid sending sensitive or personal information in prompts.
- Don't rely on the LLM for critical decision-making without human oversight.

Example:

```go
prompt := gollm.NewPrompt("Summarize the following text:").
    Directive("Focus on key points").
    Directive("Use simple language").
    MaxLength(150).
    Input(longText)
```

## Error Handling and Logging

### Do's:
- Implement robust error handling for all LLM operations.
- Log errors and unexpected behaviors for monitoring and debugging.
- Use structured logging for easier parsing and analysis.

### Don'ts:
- Don't ignore errors returned by the `gollm` package.
- Avoid logging sensitive information.

Example:

```go
response, _, err := llm.Generate(ctx, prompt.String())
if err != nil {
    log.Printf("Error generating response: %v", err)
    // Handle the error appropriately
    return
}
```

## Performance Optimization

### Do's:
- Use goroutines for concurrent LLM requests when appropriate.
- Implement caching for frequently requested information.
- Monitor and optimize token usage to control costs.

### Don'ts:
- Don't overload the LLM with unnecessary requests.
- Avoid using the LLM for tasks that can be efficiently done with traditional programming.

Example of concurrent requests:

```go
var wg sync.WaitGroup
responses := make(chan string, len(questions))

for _, q := range questions {
    wg.Add(1)
    go func(question string) {
        defer wg.Done()
        response, err := gollm.QuestionAnswer(ctx, llm, question)
        if err != nil {
            log.Printf("Error answering question: %v", err)
            return
        }
        responses <- response
    }(q)
}

wg.Wait()
close(responses)
```

## Security Considerations

### Do's:
- Implement input validation and sanitization before sending data to the LLM.
- Use HTTPS for all API communications.
- Regularly update the `gollm` package to get the latest security patches.

### Don'ts:
- Don't expose the LLM directly to user input without proper safeguards.
- Avoid storing or transmitting user data through the LLM unless necessary and compliant with privacy regulations.

## Monitoring and Observability

### Do's:
- Implement monitoring for LLM request latency, error rates, and token usage.
- Set up alerts for abnormal behavior or exceeded thresholds.
- Use distributed tracing to understand the flow of requests through your system.

### Don'ts:
- Don't rely solely on LLM provider dashboards for monitoring.
- Avoid ignoring performance degradation or unexpected behavior.

## Conclusion

By following these guidelines, you can effectively leverage the `gollm` package in a production environment. Remember to continuously monitor, test, and optimize your LLM integration to ensure it meets your application's needs and performance requirements.
